## Python 3 coding implementation on this paper
***Algorithm GR and 3.2 and 3.3(the pricing algorithm for column generation)***

(Well, I have to admit that my code is neither elegant nor concise...)  
- P.S. There is still something I feel a bit of worried, i.e. in most cases I just need at most ONE branching to get sol. of ILP  

- How does multi-branching work? I am still struggling...but now I must put it aside and work on sth else.  

**A painful but fruitful journey!**
